error message : Your branch and origin branch is diverged.

Main cause:
origin branch : a->b->c->d
local branch : a->b->e->f->g

when you try to merge you will get an error.

In order to solve this we have 2 solutions:

  Solution 1 : git rebase origin/master
    the graph will look like this : a->b->c->d->e->f->g


  Solution 2 : git merge origin/master

    from the divergence it acts like different branch, later you merge it.

                                             c->d\  
                                             ^
      this graph will look like this : a->b/ ->h //both d and g get merged
                                         \>
                                           e->f->g/
