Uses of git 

-> helps us to maintain different version of the code.
-> helps us to synchronise code between different people.
-> test changes to our code without losing the original.
-> revert back to old version of code.

git commands:

git clone <url> : this command is used to take a repository from the internet and download it onto our own computer.

save points are called commits. when we say we are making commit that means we are saving current state of all the files.

git add <file_name> : 

git commit -m : to commit

git status : It will tell us what is happening inside of this repository.

git push : it makes you to push your repository to the remote repository

***************
short hand for adding all the file and commiting at the same time is git commit -am "<message>"
