This contains everything which is learnt from the video.

Uses of git 

-> helps us to maintain different version of the code.
-> helps us to synchronise code between different people.
-> test changes to our code without losing the original.
-> revert back to old version of code.

git commands:

git clone <url> : this command is used to take a repository from the internet and download it onto our own computer.

save points are called commits. when we say we are making commit that means we are saving current state of all the files.

git add <file_name> : 

git commit -m : to commit

git status : It will tell us what is happening inside of this repository.

git push : it makes you to push your repository to the remote repository

***************
short hand for adding all the file and commiting at the same time is git commit -am "<message>"
***************


****************
merge conflict : when me and other devloper try to make changes to same line we will have merge conflict, git will not know what to do in 
this time so we explicitly have to manage this.
****************

git log : git log will give you all the commits which you have made.

git reset : git reset is used to take you back to the older version of your code, there are two types of git reset which you can make 
-> git reset --hard <commit hash> : will take you to the version of that particular commit hashx
-> git reset --hard origin/master : will make your repository like the online git repository.   

*****************
Branching : branching is working on different parts of the repository at the same time.

*****************

master branch is the default branch which contains up-to date, stable version of your code. 

head : head just refers to at what branch we are pointing to if there are multiple branch.

git branch : this will let you to show all the branches available and the current branch you will be working on.

git checkout -b <branch_name> : to create a new branch and to start working on that branch.

git checkout <branch_name> : will take you to that branch.
